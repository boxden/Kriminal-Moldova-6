Ogg Vorbis Premiere plug-in
by Brendan Bolles <brendan@fnordware.com>

Version 0.5b6 - 30 January 2016


Intro
=====

Ogg Vorbis is a free-as-in-beer, free-as-in-speech compressed audio format. Sort of like MP3 or AAC, but open source.  More info here:

http://www.vorbis.com/


This plug-in also includes support for the lossless FLAC and high-quality Opus formats:

http://xiph.org/flac/
http://opus-codec.org/



Installation
============

Copy the plug-in to the shared MediaCore directory:

Mac:
Ogg Premiere.bundle -> /Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/Plug-ins/CSX/MediaCore

Win:
Ogg.prm -> C:\Program Files\Adobe\Common\Plug-ins\CSX\MediaCore


Replace "CSX" with your version.  For the latest Premiere Pro CC release, it will be "7.0".


Usage
=====

When installed, you'll be able to import am .ogg file into Premiere.

Go to File > Export > Media and choose Ogg Vorbis as the format to encode an Ogg file.  Ditto for Ogg Opus and FLAC.



Open Source
===========

Like Ogg Vorbis itself, this plug-in is open source.  See the code and participate here:
